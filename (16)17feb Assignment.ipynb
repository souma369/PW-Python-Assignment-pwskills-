    "This line of code creates a connection to the MongoDB database.\n",
    "The pymongo.MongoClient() function is used to establish a connection.\n",
    "The argument \"mongodb://localhost:27017/\" specifies the URL of the MongoDB server. In this case, it's connecting to the default instance running on the local machine (localhost) \n",
    "at port 27017.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, pymongo.MongoClient() establishes a connection to the MongoDB server, allowing your Python application to interact with the database. This is the first step in any \n",

    "\n",
    "2.Access a Database:\n",
    "\n",

    "6.Update a Document:\n",
    "\n",
    "                    a). collection.update_one({\"name\": \"John Doe\"}, {\"$set\": {\"age\": 31}}) updates a document, setting the age field to 31.\n",

    "The sort() method in MongoDB is used to sort the documents in a collection based on specified criteria. It allows you to control the order in which documents are \n",
    "returned in the result set. Here's a brief explanation of how the sort() method works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "                  The sort() method takes one or more fields and their respective sort order (ascending or descending) as parameters. It has the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                         db.collection_name.find().sort({ field1: order1, field2: order2, ... })\n",
    "                         field1, field2, etc.: The fields by which you want to sort the documents.\n",
    "                        order1, order2, etc.: The sort order for each field. Use 1 for ascending order and -1 for descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Example:\n",
    "            Let's say you have a collection named users with documents containing name and age fields. You want to retrieve the documents sorted by age in descending order:\n",
    "\n",
    "               db.users.find().sort({ age: -1 })\n",
    "\n",
    "                  This query will return the documents from the users collection sorted by age in descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    3. Multi-key Sorting:\n",
    "\n",
    "                         You can sort by multiple fields in MongoDB. In this case, documents are first sorted by the first field, and then within each group of documents \n",
    "                         with the same value for the first field, they are sorted by the second field, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                          db.users.find().sort({ field1: order1, field2: order2 })\n",
    "                          For example, to sort by age in descending order and then by name in ascending order:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                          db.users.find().sort({ age: -1, name: 1 })\n",
    " \n",
    "    4. Sorting by Nested Fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "                             You can also sort by fields within nested objects. For example, if you have a document structure like:\n",
    "                             {\n",
    "                              name: \"John Doe\",\n",
    "                              address: {\n",
    "                              city: \"New York\",\n",
    "                              state: \"NY\"\n",
    "                                }\n",
    "                               }\n",
    "                            You can sort by address.city:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                           db.users.find().sort({ \"address.city\": 1 })\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Limiting the Number of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "                                     You can combine sort() with limit() to retrieve a specific number of sorted documents:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                                     db.users.find().sort({ age: -1 }).limit(5)\n",
    "\n",
    "                    \n",
    "    6. Note:\n",
    "\n",
    "           The sort() method does not modify the documents in the collection; it only affects the order in which they are returned in the query result.\n",

    "In MongoDB, delete_one(), delete_many(), and drop() are methods used for removing documents or entire collections from a database. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n",

    "A.  delete_one():\n",
    "\n",
    "              The delete_one() method is used to delete a single document from a collection that matches a specified filter.\n",

    "               Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                      db.collection_name.delete_one({ key: value })\n",
    "                       This will delete the first document that matches the specified filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "            Use Case: \n",
    "                     When you want to remove a specific document that meets certain criteria.\n",

    "B. delete_many():\n",

    "                 db.collection_name.delete_many({ key: value })\n",

    "C. drop():\n",

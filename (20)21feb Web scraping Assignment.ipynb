    "Flask is used in a web scraping project for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "       1. Lightweight and Minimalistic: \n",
    "                                      Flask is a lightweight micro-framework for Python. It provides just the essentials needed to build web applications. In a web scraping project,\n",
    "                                    where the focus is on data extraction and processing, a minimalistic framework like Flask is preferred as it doesn't introduce unnecessary overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "       2. Easy to Learn and Use:\n",
    "                               Flask has a simple and intuitive syntax, making it easy for developers to pick up and start using quickly. This is especially beneficial for web scraping \n",
    "                               projects where the primary focus is on extracting data from websites, and a complex web framework might be overkill.\n",
    "\n",
    "       3. Routing and URL Handling:\n",
    "                                 Flask provides a clean and intuitive way to define routes and handle URLs. This is useful for setting up endpoints to receive HTTP requests, \n",
    "                                 which can be helpful in a web scraping project where you might want to expose specific endpoints for data retrieval or processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "       4. Template Rendering:\n",
    "                            While not a primary concern in a web scraping project, Flask's template rendering engine (Jinja2) can be beneficial if you need to create \n",

    "\n",
    "       5. Integration with Python Libraries: \n",
    "                                           Flask seamlessly integrates with a wide range of Python libraries. This can be extremely useful in a web scraping project where \n",
    "                                           you might need to use additional libraries for tasks like data manipulation, analysis, or visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "       6. Building APIs for Data Consumption:\n",
    "                                             In more advanced use cases, Flask can be used to create a RESTful API to expose the scraped data. This allows for easy integration \n",
    "                                             with other applications or services. For instance, the scraped data can be consumed by a mobile app, a data dashboard, \n",
    "                                            or even used as a backend for a web application.\n",

    "                    \n",
    "    In summary, Flask is used in web scraping projects primarily for its simplicity, lightweight nature, and ease of integration with Python libraries.\n",
    "    Additionally, its ability to handle routing and URLs, as well as its potential for building APIs, makes it a versatile choice for building lightweight\n",

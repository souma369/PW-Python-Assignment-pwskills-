    "\n",
    "\n",

    "                                   This clause specifies the condition for the join. It defines how the rows from one table relate to the rows in another table.\n",

    "                13. CASE:\n",
    "                         The CASE statement allows for conditional logic within a query. It's similar to an if-else statement in programming.\n",
    "\n",

    "                                               These are queries embedded within other queries. They can be used in the WHERE, FROM, or SELECT clause.\n",

    "                                      These are used with the SELECT clause to perform operations on a set of values and return a single result. \n",

    "            21. Self-Join:\n",
    "                            A self-join is when a table is joined with itself. This can be useful in hierarchical data structures or when comparing records within the same table.\n",

    "  A. Encapsulation: \n",
    "                    Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and methods together with in a class. By encapsulating data you can hide the internal implementation details \n",
    "                    and provide access to the data through well-defined methods or properties.This allow you to control how the data is accessed and manipulated providing a level \n",
    "                     of abstraction. Use access modifiers like private(using the underscore convention) to restrict direct access to internal data and provide getter and setter methods \n",
    "                      to interact with the data.\n",

    "                               hide the underlying implementation details and provide a simplified and intuitive way to interact with the data.\n",
